# Pioneer of Food Remedies

## Summary
**Pioneer of Food Remedies** is an AI-powered chatbot designed to provide insights into food-based remedies, facts about foods, their medicinal uses and dietary recommendations during sickness. The chatbot leverages a **Large Language Model (LLM)** trained on a curated dataset and deployed using **Streamlit** for an interactive user experience. By integrating advanced **natural language processing** techniques, this chatbot enables users to explore food-based health solutions efficiently.

## Languages and Libraries Used
- **Programming Languages:**
  - Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks:**
  - `transformers` (Hugging Face LLM model training and inference)
  - `streamlit` (Web deployment)
  - `langchain` 
  - **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for contextual search
  - `pandas` (Data handling)
  - `numpy` (Numerical computations)

## Key Learnings
- **Generative AI and Neural Networks:** Understanding how LLMs work, including tokenization, embeddings, and training on domain-specific data.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Implementing a hybrid approach where the LLM dynamically retrieves information to enhance response accuracy.
- **Deploying AI Models:** Gained experience in deploying machine learning models using Streamlit for real-time interaction.
- **Effective Communication:** Translating technical insights into user-friendly interactions, ensuring accessibility for non-technical users.

## Challenges Overcame
- **Model Fine-Tuning:** Ensuring the LLM provided accurate and relevant responses required fine-tuning on domain-specific food remedy data.
- **Efficient Retrieval Mechanism:** Implementing **RAG** to optimize search efficiency and provide factually accurate responses.
- **Deployment Optimization:** Overcoming performance bottlenecks while deploying the model on **Streamlit** to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience.

## Additional Reflections
- The project reinforced the importance of integrating AI with real-world applications, particularly in the **health and wellness** domain.
- Exploring **LangChain** and **RAG** provided a deeper understanding of how retrieval-based techniques can enhance LLM capabilities.
- Future improvements could include expanding the chatbotâ€™s **knowledge base** and integrating **voice-based interactions** for accessibility.
